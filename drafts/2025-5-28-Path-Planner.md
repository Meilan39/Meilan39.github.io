# Description

This project details the application of [cubic Hermite spline interpolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubic_Hermite_spline) in smooth path generation for differential and holonomic [Vex](https://www.vexrobotics.com/) robots. Path generation is simplified through the use of a [Desmos](https://www.desmos.com/) The project also proposes a simple method to generate a velocity profile given a initial and final velocity, initial and final acceleration, and distance.
